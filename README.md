# 📚 StudyLingo

AI-powered multilingual study assistant that helps students learn through multiple language perspectives.

## 🎯 The Problem

Students often struggle with complex educational content. Language barriers and unfamiliar terminology make learning harder. Traditional translation tools don't help students understand concepts - they just translate words.

## 💡 The Solution

StudyLingo transforms how students learn by:
- Providing instant translations in 5 languages
- Visualizing word patterns and text complexity
- Letting students search for specific topics across languages
- Showing how different cultures explain the same concepts

## ✨ Key Features

### Instant Multilingual Translation
Translate study materials into Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Arabic with one click.

### Interactive Data Visualizations
- Word Frequency Chart - Identify key terms at a glance
- Language Comparison - See how translation lengths vary
- Complexity Meter - Understand text difficulty level

### Study Helper
Ask about specific topics and get relevant excerpts in all 5 languages. Perfect for finding key concepts quickly, learning terminology across languages, and understanding how different languages explain concepts.

### Dark Mode
Easy on the eyes for late-night study sessions.
